# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project predicts whether a person has heart disease using machine learning algorithms. It is implemented in **Python using Jupyter Notebook** and uses a medical dataset containing patient health parameters.

The system helps in early detection of heart disease by analyzing important features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart rate.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately classify patients as having heart disease or not.

## 📊 Dataset Details

The dataset includes the following attributes:

* age – Age of the patient
* sex – Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
* cp – Chest pain type
* trestbps – Resting blood pressure

* fbs – Fasting blood sugar
* restecg – Resting ECG result
* thalach – Maximum heart rate achieved
* exang – Exercise-induced angina
* oldpeak – ST depression
* slope – Slope of peak exercise ST segment
* ca – Number of major vessels
* thal – Thalassemia
* target – 1 (Heart Disease), 0 (No Heart Disease)
